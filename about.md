The Open Franchise Project was built on the idea of open-sourced disruptive enterprises practically inspired by the current franchise business model. However, there are alot of issues it tackles. 

**Issues such as**
1. Fee restrictions
2. Degree of openess
3. Faster scalability
4. Integrations of technology
4. Modern monetary gain policies

Outside of this, franchises are extremely centralized. A new framework or proposal can be set in place that allows for higher mutual benefit for both parties involved. This proposal will look into *technological and methodological designs* regarding each issue. The reasoning behind open franchises go beyond these main issues, but also tackles the root problem of centralization. How can one have a more open business model, but still have higher perceived benefit over closed business models?
