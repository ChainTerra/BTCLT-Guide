CloutPool works on a series of innovative technologies centered around mining for and supporting the BitClout ecosystem. They are a third party project not directly tied to or affiliated with the development team behind BitClout. 

This guide is being created to provide to you insights regarding the mining process, software setup, and different configurations so that you are able to get started much quicker. Currently this guide is experimental, but shall be updated as time progresses.

**Issues such as**
1. Fee restrictions
2. Degree of openess
3. Faster scalability
4. Integrations of technology
4. Modern monetary gain policies

This proposal will look into *technological and methodological designs* regarding each issue. The reasoning behind open franchises go beyond these main issues, but also tackles the root problem of centralization. How can one have a more open business model, but still have higher perceived benefit over closed business models?
