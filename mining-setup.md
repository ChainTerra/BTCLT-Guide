Right now this is experimental, but here is the guide as it currently stands *(as of time last updated)*:

**For the core node:** \
`git clone https://github.com/bitclout/core` \
`git clone https://github.com/bitclout/backend` \
`cd backend` \
`docker build -t ubuntu-test:latest .` \
`cd ../` \
`cd core` \
`sudo nano run_remote_miner.sh` \
Edit `miner_public_key` value to your public key \
Run `go build` in the `core` directory \
Then also run: `docker build -t ubuntu-test:latest .` \
Theoretically, you are supposed to be able to run `./run_remote_miner.sh` to start mining. \
However, the [cmd](https://github.com/bitclout/core/cmd/) module needs to be live. Once it is, the above instructions likely should work.

**For running a mining pool:** \
`git clone https://github.com/ChainTerra/CloutPool.git` \
Make sure to run the [bitclout/core](https://github.com/bitclout/core) daemon (Dockerfile and node) first locally. \
Run `go build .` \
Copy `go-stratum-pool` and rename `config.btclt.json` to `config.json` \
Change the `rewardRecipients` address in line 18 of the config to your address. \
Run `./go-stratup-pool` and it should detect the `config.json` file and node automatically. \
You can host this in a VPS and share mining rewards w/ your "workers".
