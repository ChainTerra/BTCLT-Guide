There are a series of prerequisites and software/hardware recommendations needed to get started. These help insure that if any problems arise, you will likely have most of the dependencies needed to fix them quickly.
##### The prerequisites are as follows:
1. No upfront cost.
2. Business components are sourced openly, but with a certain set of conditions.

*The conditions are as follows:*
1. The brand equity value belongs to the original franchise entity
2. All uses of branding outside of the franchise model, goes to the original franchise entity
3. For franchise locations, they must make reference to the original location address, its branding, and its website (if applicable)
