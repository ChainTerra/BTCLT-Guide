There are a series of prerequisites and software/hardware recommendations needed to get started. These help insure that if any problems arise, you will likely have most of the dependencies needed to fix them quickly.
##### The prerequisites are as follows:
1. [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [N](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n)
2. The [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
3. The latest version of [go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
4.  [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
5.  [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) or higher OS
6.  The latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (Optional)
7.  The latest version of [NPM and Node v12.04+](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
8.   At least 1 gig of RAM abnd 5 gigs of free disk space.

Optionally, you can also install the [Sublime text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to your computer and if you are looking into a go IDE, you may want to consider [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

Even if you aren't going to use all these tools, it is recommended that you have them in the future (especially if you plan on running or mantaining a mining pool). This list doesn't include the repos or other pre-reqs that we will be downloading directly (which we will get to). The correct order for tool installation is: 8, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 4, 3.
