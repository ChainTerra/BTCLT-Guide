The business model is quite simple. It is oriented under the idea of an open system for franchises. *What does that mean?*  Well, it means following a certain set of standards or a pipeline will allow for an open system to be possible.
##### Such system is as follows:
1. No upfront cost.
2. Business components are sourced openly, but with a certain set of conditions.

*The conditions are as follows:*
1. The brand equity value belongs to the original franchise entity
2. All uses of branding outside of the franchise model, goes to the original franchise entity
3. For franchise locations, they must make reference to the original location address, its branding, and its website (if applicable)
